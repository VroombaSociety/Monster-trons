First Day Rough Draft Scripty Thing
The main character starts by waking up on the streets in ______ City (I don't have a good name, someone else come up with one.). (S)He has been living on the streets for the past 5 years, after being abandoned by his/her parents for reasons unknown. The way (s)he has been surviving is by using his/her captured creatures, called Monster-trons, which use special unexplained miraculous powers (UMPs), to help him/her get the food and clothes (s)he needs through one of three ways: working honestly, using his/her Monster-trons as assistants to all kinds of criminals, and burgling other people. (S)He has been caught a few times during the latter two activities, and there is a warrant out for him/her. (S)He is not able to find work the first day the player controls him/her, and needs to burgle someone else tonight or go hungry; (s)he hasn't been able to get food for the last couple days because (s)he doesn't like to burgle unless she has no other choice. (I suggest having the first battle with a guard or something at the house, maybe a guard 'tron?) During the burglary, (s)he is discovered by the resident of the house(mansion, maybe?) and discovers that she is actually a Monster-tron Master, of which there are very few (let's say ten or so in a world populated by about a billion people). The owner (I'm horrible with names, I'll just call her Jennifer) is intrigued by the way the main character made it past her defenses, especially the guard, and tells him/her she has seen nobody else with that close of a bond with their 'trons. Jen offers an apprenticeship to the main character if (s)he can pass a test, before taking out one of her strongest 'trons for the main character to battle. During the battle, the first 'tron the main character has is defeated, and at that point the main character yells, "Okay, you win. I didn't pass the test and I've learned my lesson! Please just let me go so I can take care of _______ (insert 'tron's name here)!" Jen replies, "No, (italics)you(end italics) win. You have proven your bond with your ______ ('tron's name) and I will take you on as an apprentice. You may heal ________ (name) in this machine. (points to machine in corner of the room)" At that point, control is given back to the player and (s)he needs to heal his/her 'tron, then is told to go to bed. (S)He obeys because there is nothing else to do. (The other doors and windows are locked now so (s)he can't get out and has to go to his/her new bed.)
